THIS IS A PERSONAL PROJECT. ANY CODE WITHIN IS NOT INHERENTLY MY OWN, BUT PROPERTY OF ITS RESPECTIVE AUTHOR.

Important Info
======

As of right now, 10/13/2018, this code is designated for use in ChromaToggle.
I say this because as of right now, if two developers were to try to use this helper class,
UI chaos would ensue. This is due to the fact that each particular instance of the helper would try to
make modifications to the object hierarchy without knowledge of each other.

One day, maybe, this will be fixed, but now that I've gotten this far I'm gonna take a break and
focus on my ScoreSaber rank ;)
