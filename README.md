THIS IS A PERSONAL PROJECT. ANY CODE WITHIN IS NOT INHERENTLY MY OWN, BUT PROPERTY OF ITS RESPECTIVE AUTHOR.

Important Info
======

I've itemized a few tips for ya!
1. This helper file now supports being used in multiple plugins.
2. Be sure to use it only in "activeSceneChanged" and not "sceneLoaded".
3. Be sure your ReflectionUtils has the proper methods to support the main helper file.

In short, use this template as an example to get you started!
